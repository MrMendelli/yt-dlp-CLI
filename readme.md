# yt-dlp CLI

## Disclaimer

_This utility **does not** include [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) or [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), but it will prompt you if either is not found with instructions._

## Introduction

This is a simplistic CLI frontend that simplifies the downloading of video or audio for with functionality for all supported output audio formats and qualities. This works for individual videos or playlists. When downloads are completed, the output folder is made and opened upon completion.

## Use

Simply download the [latest release](https://github.com/MrMendelli/yt-dlp-CLI/releases/latest) and extract to a desired location. It is not recommended to extract to a UAC-protected parent directory. Once yt-dlp and ffmpeg are downloaded and extracted, run the script and follow the prompts.

## Issues

- Even if the yt-dlp build is up-to-date, leaving the window still opens the GitHub page due to batch limitations
- ffmpeg is a requirement for downloading videos as audio in newer yt-dlp builds, a fix was implemented but there is no current implementation of checking PATH so a relative path check is used instead
- Not all base features are implemented, it is undecided if more will be added. Requests will not be taken, but PRs will be considered
- An unideal method needed to be used for downloading Vorbis audio, upon completion a command is run to change the extensions of downloaded Vorbis outfiles due to batch limitations
- Only Windows support is planned at the time of this readme's submission

## Contributing

Feel free to submit a PR, but please comment code when doing so. This is for clarity as batch has a range of use syntax and limitations that are too vast to account for so some things may seem unclear on first glance.
